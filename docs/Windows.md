# Working with N1 on Windows

N1 

# Getting Started

1. Make sure you have installed the latest Visual Studio for your version of
   Windows. For Windows 10, the free [Visual Studio Community 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/vs-2015-product-editions.aspx) was sufficient
1. Make sure you have installed Node.js. We used the Node 4.2.1 installer
   off of the node.js homepage and installed it to the default of
   `C:\Program Files\nodejs`. It came with npm 2.14.7
1. Make sure you have installed Python 2.7. We used the Python 2.7.10
   installer off of the python.org/downloads page and installed it to the
   default of `C:\Python27`
